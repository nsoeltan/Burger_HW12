Creating a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). The app will follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate HTML.

Portobello Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users enter the names of burgers they would like to eat. 

Users must enter the name of the burger they would like to eat as instructed in the form input field. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the name of the burger will be displayed on the left side of the page. 

When a user is ready to eat the burger, the user must enter his/her name as instructed in the form input field.

The user can then eat the burger by clicking on the "Eat it" button. 

When the user clicks on the "Eat it" button, the burger will be displayed on the right side of the page along with the name of the user. The burgers and the users their information will be stored in the mySQL database.
